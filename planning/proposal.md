### 🌟 Anything else your squad lead should know
> Aiming to also make this mobile-friendly to create less friction between the user and the application! Something that they can roll out of bed and use without necessarily needing to hop onto the computer.

> I’m also curious about and am considering using tailwindcss. 

STRETCH GOALS

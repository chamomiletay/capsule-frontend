### ðŸ§µ Challenges I Faced
> This project really challenged me mentally and emotionally. Throughout the course of the project, I really wanted a challenge and was very eager to reach my end goal. However, I experienced many setbacks along the way.
>
> Attempting to implement **image uploads** was one of the biggest hurdles I faced. I'm proud of myself for sticking through it, but a lot of time was sacrificed reseraching and debugging numerous methods for allowing image uploads, each of which was unsuccessful. For the sake of getting data to render, I removed any instances of requests for image uploads. I do appreciate learning this process, as it is something I would like to come back to and implement into my application.
>
> I also struggled with **getting django models data to render on the frontend properly** as well as some **deployment issues via Heroku** that I was not able to resolve, thus causing me to rebuild my backend quite a few times.
>
> Additionally, I was struck by illness leading up to conclusion of the project, but I powered through and ensured that the most essential django data was able to render despite the numerous technical issues I faced.
